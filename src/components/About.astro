      I'm Klas, an enthusiastic and aspiring front-end developer who also loves
      to design. I'm currently pursuing my studies in Stockholm, Sweden. My
      creativity has been evident through my passion for snowboarding,
      photography, and experiences as a furniture maker.</p><p>Mostly, I work with React, TypeScript and Tailwind. I enjoy using <a class="link" href="https://astro.build/">Astro.</a> and traditional CSS whenever possible. I create designs in Figma, and there was a time when I <a class="link" href="https://elastomania.com/">Elasto Mania</a> extensively.
