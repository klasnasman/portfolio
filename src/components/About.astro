      <p>Hello,</p>I'm <span class="link">Klas<Image class="about__thumb" width={200} src={klas} alt="Klas" /></span>, a front-end developer with a love for design. My
      creativity has been evident through my passion for <span class="link">snowboarding<Image class="about__thumb" width={200} src={snowboard} alt="Snowboard" /></span>,
      <a class="link" href="https://brollop.klasnasman.com/" target="_blank">photography</a>, and experiences as a furniture maker.<p>Mostly, I work with React, Typescript and Tailwind. I enjoy using <a class="link" href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a> and traditional CSS whenever possible. I do designs in Figma, and there was a time when I held a world record on <span class="link">Elasto Mania<Image class="about__thumb" width={200} src={elasto} alt="Elasto Mania" /></span>.</p>
