The main driving force in the development of this work, was the intention of framing the record of public space interventions throughout the 20th Century. Through a selection of significant cases and authors, this research aims to catalogue about a century of intellectual and artistic experimentations – while offering a synthesized method to plan and design such interventions, contextualising them through history.

Each section of the book is supported by a rich iconographic apparatus through which the reader can intuitively gain insight about the visual and theoretical background supporting these cases.
